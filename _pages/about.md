Trained in applied mathematics, I have strong interests in Bayesian statistics, machine learning, and time series. Profesionally I leverage these skills to give more clarity to structures in their decision-making processes.

What I am working on:

- Uncertainty maps by pathology types in french territory
- Data chain audit (a public health case-study)
- Cancer incidence rates differences
