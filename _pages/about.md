Trained in applied mathematics, I work at the intersection of Bayesian and computational statistics, machine learning, and data analytics.

Outside consulting and research, I practice music theory, MIR, bouldering, and chess, and I explore how these domains inform each other — structure, rhythm, optimisation, signal.

This site collects notes, projects, and lightweight experiments.
