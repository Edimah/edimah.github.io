No time like the present: I imported and parsed my personal health data and decided to play around with it.</p> <iframe src="/assets/html/workout_types_20250926_221543.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>Starting with a <strong>bar plot</strong> showing the distributions of my physical activities, using parts of my final dataset. Hovering over each bar should show counts for each workout type !</p> <p>Though this graph doesn‚Äôt say much about trends and performances, I‚Äôm surprised to see which activity actually dominates my routine üßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I guess doing short flows consistently before and after other workouts tends to add up !</p> <p>Looks like I could benefit from going outside more, though. Unless plotting my workout data against time shows unexpected trends‚Ä¶</p> <p><em>TBC.</em></p> <p>This quick visual is the first in a series of short posts exploring my own Apple Health metrics through a holistic lense: descriptive, inferential and predictive statistics.</p> <p>For anyone interested, a lightweight version of my script is available in my <a href="https://github.com/Edimah/apple-health-data"><strong>Apple Health Data</strong> GitHub repo</a>. Feel free to use it !</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="posts"/><category term="dataviz"/><category term="fitness"/><category term="health"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I imported and visualised 20 months of Apple Health data üèÉüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è to get a broader view of how I trained.]]></summary></entry></feed>
